# **Summary**: #
The goal of this project is to make use of LastFM's WS interface and bring Last.FM to pidgin. Like any other music player plugins for pidgin, this will also update the user's status with the most recent song played.

## **NEWS**: ##
The plugin is now ready for use! Release available in the downloads section.

## **NOTE**: ##
Please email me if you want to help contribute code/patches. The code base is currently an Eclipse C/C++ project and builds the final shared library which can just be dropped into ~/.purple/plugins or /usr/lib/pidgin.

## **CREDITS:** ##
A lot of the code came from various sources, but a good major chunk came from the musictracker plugin project. This was my first attempt at a come back to C programming so please critique away!
